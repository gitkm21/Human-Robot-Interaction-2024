# How to run the Pepper2.5OUS program on Pepper:

Connect to Pepper on the browser then on Choregraphe and launch Pepper2.5OUS.pml

You must choose whether the questions will be said in a neutral, angry, or sad voice.
You must now choose whether you want the exact Oxford Utilitarian Scale's (Human) questions or the questions adapted for Pepper specifically.

The participant will then just have to touch the tablet to launch the programm
The program should then run without interference.
The participants can answer out loud or by touching the screen, but they have to wait until Pepper stops talking.

WARNING: The data must be saved manually after each participant. It will be logged like so : 
Results XXXXXXX [the data] XXXXXXX
You must copy the list to another file.

If you have forgottent to save the data but havent turned Pepper off yet, there might be a chance to get it back.
Run the 'collected data' module in choregraphe to log all the data gathered durinng this session (since Pepper was last turned on).

In the saved data, the first letter indicates the gender (Male/Female); the second indicates the agent (Human/Pepper); the third the emotion (Angry/Sad/Neutral); and the numner indicates the exact question.
